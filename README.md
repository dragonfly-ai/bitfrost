This Scala.js library cross compiles to JavaScript and JVM environments to bring support for color spaces and color
science to both.  



In addition to support for common color spaces: ARGB, NRGB, HSV, HSL, and CYMK, this library
also provides convenient access to color spaces designed around human color
perception research like L* a* b*, and L* u* v*.
